# Invoice Payment Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Invoice Payment feature integrates the accounting system with an external DDS application through API endpoints to manage invoice payments. This feature provides a comprehensive view of invoice status, payment tracking, and financial analytics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Three-Tab Interface**

-   **Dashboard Tab**: Overview cards showing key metrics
-   **Waiting Payment Tab**: Table of invoices awaiting payment with search functionality
-   **Paid Invoices Tab**: Historical view of completed payments with search functionality

### 2. **Dashboard Analytics**

-   Total invoices count
-   Waiting payment invoices count
-   Paid invoices count
-   Overdue invoices count (invoices older than 30 days)
-   Total waiting amount
-   Total paid amount

### 3. **Search Capabilities**

-   Search by invoice number
-   Search by supplier name
-   Search by project code
-   Real-time filtering on client-side

### 4. **Days Calculation**

-   Calculates days between invoice receive date and current date
-   Rounded to whole days (no decimal)
-   Color-coded display:
    -   Green: â‰¤ 15 days
    -   Yellow: 16-30 days
    -   Red: > 30 days (overdue)

## Technical Implementation

### Controller

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/InvoicePaymentController.php`

**Key Methods**:

-   `index()`: Main view display
-   `dashboard()`: API endpoint for dashboard data
-   `waitingPayment()`: API endpoint for waiting payment invoices
-   `paidInvoices()`: API endpoint for paid invoices

**API Integration**:

-   Uses Laravel's HTTP client for external API calls
-   Environment variables for configuration:
    -   `DDS_API_URL`: Base URL for DDS API
    -   `DDS_API_KEY`: Authentication key
    -   `DDS_DEPARTMENT_CODE`: Department identifier

### Routes

**File**: `routes/cashier.php`

```php
Route::prefix('invoice-payment')->name('invoice-payment.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [InvoicePaymentController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/dashboard', [InvoicePaymentController::class, 'dashboard'])->name('dashboard');
    Route::get('/waiting-payment', [InvoicePaymentController::class, 'waitingPayment'])->name('waiting');
    Route::get('/paid-invoices', [InvoicePaymentController::class, 'paidInvoices'])->name('paid');
});
```

### Views

**File**: `resources/views/invoice-payment/index.blade.php`

**Features**:

-   Bootstrap tabs for navigation
-   Responsive design with AdminLTE styling
-   AJAX-powered data loading
-   Client-side search and filtering
-   Currency formatting (IDR)
-   Date formatting (Indonesian locale)

### Menu Integration

**File**: `resources/views/templates/partials/menu/cashier.blade.php`

Added new menu item under Cashier dropdown:

```blade
@can('akses_invoice_payment')
    <li><a href="{{ route('cashier.invoice-payment.index') }}" class="dropdown-item">Invoice Payment</a></li>
@endcan
```

## API Integration Details

### DDS API Endpoints Used

-   `GET /departments/{department_code}/invoices` - Retrieve invoices for department

### Data Processing

1. **Invoice Filtering**: Separates invoices by status (open/pending vs closed/paid)
2. **Days Calculation**: Uses Carbon library for date difference calculation
3. **Search Implementation**: Client-side filtering for better performance
4. **Sorting**:
    - Waiting invoices: Oldest first (priority for payment)
    - Paid invoices: Most recent first (historical view)

### Error Handling

-   Comprehensive try-catch blocks
-   Logging of API errors
-   Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
-   User-friendly error messages

## Security Features

### Permission System

-   Requires `akses_invoice_payment` permission
-   Integrated with existing Spatie Laravel Permission system
-   Middleware protection on all routes

### API Security

-   API key authentication
-   Environment variable configuration
-   No sensitive data exposure in frontend

## User Experience Features

### Responsive Design

-   Bootstrap 4 responsive grid system
-   Mobile-friendly interface
-   AdminLTE styling consistency

### Interactive Elements

-   Real-time search functionality
-   Refresh buttons for data updates
-   Loading states and error handling
-   Tab-based navigation

### Data Visualization

-   Color-coded status indicators
-   Currency formatting for amounts
-   Date formatting for better readability
-   Visual indicators for overdue invoices

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

```env
DDS_API_URL=https://your-dds-api-domain.com/api/v1
DDS_API_KEY=your_dds_api_key_here
DDS_DEPARTMENT_CODE=000HACC
```

### Permission Setup

The `akses_invoice_payment` permission must be created manually through the application's permission management interface.

## Performance Considerations

### API Optimization

-   Single API call per tab load
-   Client-side filtering for search
-   Efficient data processing with minimal server load

### Caching Strategy

-   No server-side caching (always fresh data as requested)
-   Client-side data retention during session
-   Optimized AJAX calls with proper error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Server-side Pagination**: For large invoice datasets
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range filters, amount ranges
3. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of invoice data
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
5. **Bulk Operations**: Mass status updates, bulk payments
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Charts and graphs for payment trends

### Monitoring and Analytics

1. **API Performance Metrics**: Response time tracking
2. **User Activity Logging**: Feature usage analytics
3. **Error Rate Monitoring**: API failure tracking
4. **Performance Alerts**: Slow response notifications

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Permission Access**: Verify only authorized users can access
2. **API Integration**: Test with valid/invalid API credentials
3. **Search Functionality**: Test search across different fields
4. **Data Display**: Verify correct formatting and calculations
5. **Error Handling**: Test API failures and network issues

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Controller method testing
2. **Feature Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
3. **API Mocking**: External API response simulation
4. **Permission Testing**: Access control validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failures**: Check environment variables and network connectivity
2. **Permission Errors**: Verify `akses_invoice_payment` permission exists
3. **Data Loading Issues**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **Search Not Working**: Verify JavaScript is enabled and jQuery is loaded

### Debug Information

-   Check Laravel logs for API errors
-   Browser console for JavaScript errors
-   Network tab for API request/response details
-   Verify environment variable configuration

## Conclusion

The Invoice Payment feature successfully integrates external DDS API data with the existing accounting system, providing users with comprehensive invoice management capabilities. The implementation follows Laravel best practices, includes proper security measures, and delivers an intuitive user experience.

The feature is production-ready and can be extended with additional functionality based on user feedback and business requirements.
