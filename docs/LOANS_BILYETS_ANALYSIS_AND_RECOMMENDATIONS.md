-   ‚úÖ Logic reusable
-   ‚úÖ Easy to test
-   ‚úÖ Single responsibility

**Example**:

```php
// Bad: Logic in controller
public function pay($id) {
    // 50 lines of business logic
}

// Good: Logic in service
public function pay($id) {
    return $this->paymentService->processPayment($id);
}
```

---

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What**: Use events and listeners for cross-cutting concerns

**Benefits**:

-   ‚úÖ Loose coupling
-   ‚úÖ Easy to extend
-   ‚úÖ No manual audit logging
-   ‚úÖ Can add features without modifying existing code

**Example**:

```php
// Just fire event
event(new LoanCreated($loan, $user));

// Listener automatically:
// - Logs to audit trail
// - Sends notifications (future)
// - Updates statistics (future)
```

---

### 3. Pre-filled Forms ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What**: Auto-populate forms with related data

**Benefits**:

-   ‚úÖ Reduces data entry
-   ‚úÖ Minimizes errors
-   ‚úÖ Faster workflows
-   ‚úÖ Better UX

**Example**: Create bilyet from installment

-   Amount: Pre-filled from installment
-   Date: Pre-filled with due date
-   Remarks: Auto-generated
-   **User only enters**: bilyet number, bank account

---

### 4. Enum Fields for Categories ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What**: Use database enums for fixed option sets

**Benefits**:

-   ‚úÖ Database-level validation
-   ‚úÖ Prevents invalid values
-   ‚úÖ Clear semantics
-   ‚úÖ Extensible

**Example**: payment_method ENUM('bilyet','auto_debit',...)

-   Can't insert invalid value
-   Easy to add new methods
-   Clear in reports

---

### 5. Backward Compatibility ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What**: Keep existing fields while adding new ones

**Benefits**:

-   ‚úÖ No data loss
-   ‚úÖ Gradual migration
-   ‚úÖ No breaking changes
-   ‚úÖ Risk reduction

**Example**: Keep bilyet_no field, add bilyet_id

-   Old data still accessible
-   New data uses FK
-   Views handle both

---

## üìö INTEGRATION PATTERNS FOR OTHER MODULES

### Pattern 1: Related Entity Linking

**Use Case**: Link Payreq to Invoice Payment

**Pattern**:

```php
// Add nullable FK
ALTER TABLE payreqs ADD COLUMN invoice_payment_id BIGINT NULL;

// Add relationship
class Payreq {
    public function invoicePayment() {
        return $this->belongsTo(InvoicePayment::class);
    }
}

// Service layer
class PayreqService {
    public function linkToInvoicePayment($payreq_id, $invoice_payment_id) {
        // Validate, link, audit
    }
}
```

---

### Pattern 2: Multi-Workflow Actions

**Use Case**: Realization can be approved OR rejected

**Pattern**:

```html
<!-- Show appropriate buttons based on state -->
@if($realization->status == 'submitted')
<button data-target="#approve-modal">Approve</button>
<button data-target="#reject-modal">Reject</button>
@endif

<!-- Each button opens different modal with appropriate form -->
```

**Key**: Conditional UI based on state, separate modals for clarity

---

### Pattern 3: Purpose/Category Fields

**Use Case**: Categorize transactions by purpose

**Pattern**:

```php
// Add enum field
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN category ENUM('revenue','expense','transfer','adjustment');

// Use in reporting
$revenueTransactions = Transaction::where('category', 'revenue')->sum('amount');
```

**When to Use**: Any entity with multiple use cases or purposes
