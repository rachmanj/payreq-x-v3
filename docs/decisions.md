# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-004: Invoice Payment Feature Implementation (2025-09-04)

### Status

Accepted

### Context

The project needed to integrate with a DDS (Document Distribution System) application to manage invoice payments. This required creating a new feature that could communicate with external APIs, display invoice data, and allow users to update payment statuses.

### Decision

We implemented a comprehensive Invoice Payment feature with the following architecture:

1. **Controller-based API Integration**: Used Laravel HTTP Client to communicate with DDS API endpoints
2. **DataTables Frontend**: Implemented DataTables for enhanced user experience with search, sorting, and pagination
3. **Modal-based Payment Updates**: Created a payment modal for updating invoice statuses
4. **Real-time Dashboard**: Built a dashboard with real-time statistics
5. **Permission-based Access**: Used Spatie Laravel Permission for access control

### Consequences

#### Positive

-   **Enhanced User Experience**: DataTables provide excellent search, sorting, and pagination capabilities
-   **Real-time Updates**: Tables refresh automatically after payment updates
-   **Secure Integration**: Proper API key authentication and CSRF protection
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allows for easy extension
-   **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive logging for debugging and monitoring
