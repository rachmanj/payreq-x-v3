### [007] Bilyet Edit Dialog Date Field Population Fix (2025-09-16) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge**: Bilyet edit dialog was not populating the Bilyet Date field despite having valid data in the database, causing poor user experience and confusion during editing operations.

**Solution**: Identified root cause as Laravel's date casting returning Carbon objects instead of formatted strings required by HTML date inputs. Updated view template to use `$model->bilyet_date->format('Y-m-d')` with proper null checks for both bilyet_date and cair_date fields.

**Key Learning**: Laravel's Eloquent date casting returns Carbon instances, but HTML date inputs require specific `Y-m-d` format strings. Always check data types when debugging form field population issues. The fix ensures consistent date formatting across the application and improves user experience by showing current values in edit forms.

**Technical Details**:

-   **Root Cause**: Laravel date casting returns Carbon objects, HTML date inputs need strings
-   **Solution**: Added `.format('Y-m-d')` with null checks in Blade template
